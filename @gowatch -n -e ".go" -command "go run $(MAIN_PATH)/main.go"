**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **`dev:`**: Defines the new `dev` command.
*   **`@echo "Running in development mode with gowatch..."`**: Prints a message to the console.
*   **`@gowatch -n -e ".go" -command "go run $(MAIN_PATH)/main.go"`**:  This is the core of the `dev` command:
    *   ``@``: Prevents the command itself from being printed to the console.
    *   `gowatch`:  Invokes the `gowatch` tool.
    *   `-n`:  Disables the initial build.
    *   `-e ".go"`: Specifies that `gowatch` should monitor files with the `.go` extension for changes.
    *   `-command "go run $(MAIN_PATH)/main.go"`:  Specifies the command to execute when a `.go` file changes.  In this case, it runs your `main.go` file.

**To use the `dev` command:**

1.  Make sure you have `gowatch` installed: `go install github.com/radovskyb/gowatch/cmd/gowatch@latest`
2.  Run `make dev` in your terminal.

This will start `gowatch`, which will monitor your `.go` files for changes and automatically restart your application whenever a change is detected.  It assumes your `main.go` file is in the root directory of your project (as indicated by `MAIN_PATH=.`).
